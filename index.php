                            The well-known anime (not to be confused with manga!) called Attack on Titan, AKA AoT, is soon to reach it's end sadly.
                            The anime started on April 7th 2013.

                            After Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry tumbled to the floor, Boston Celtics guard Marcus Smart inadvertently dove toward his knees. Will the Warriors’ NBA title chances also dive because of that sequence?

                            The Warriors said they will reevaluate Curry in two weeks after an MRI revealed that he sprained a ligament in his left foot ligament following Smart’s collision in last Wednesday’s loss to Boston. That ensures that Curry will have missed seven contests, which includes Sunday’s loss to San Antonio as well as games against Orlando (Tuesday), Miami (Wednesday), Atlanta (Friday), Washington (Sunday), Memphis (March 28) and Phoenix (March 30).

                            But what about after that? Will Curry play in any regular-season games? How about the playoffs?

                            There are lots of unanswered questions about him and it’s no wonder, then, that a few Curry-related questions have appeared in this week’s mailbag.

                            Spelers die met Snoop Dogg aan de slag willen Call of Duty Warzone en Vanguard moeten iets langer wachten. Zij kunnen namelijk met de nieuwe Operator aan de slag vanaf 19 april. Daarvoor zal je de Snoop Dogg Operator Bundle moeten aanschaffen, waarmee je toegang krijgt tot een volledige Operator progression track. Naarmate je stijgt in level zal je tien verschillende items ontgrendelen, waarbij er drie exclusief zijn voor Call of Duty Vanguard.
                            Het is niet de eerste keer dat Snoop Dogg in een Call of Duty game verschijnt. Hij was eerder al te horen in Call of Duty Ghosts via een voiceover pack. Deze keer zal hij dus niet alleen zijn stem, maar ook zijn gelijkenis verlenen aan de game.

                        NBA history to post 50-plus points and 10-plus rebounds in a game. He also became the fourth-oldest player to post a 50-point game.

                        Westbrook for John Wall trade was still on the table for the LA.

                        It's almost a shock that GTA 6 is officially happening. Earlier this year, developer Rockstar
                        Games confirmed that "active development for the next entry in the Grand Theft Auto series is well underway."
                        However, it was a tiny note in a recent blog post, rather than a full-blown reveal.
                    </p>

                    <p class="game_text1">
                        For years now there's been so many GTA 6 rumors and gossip doing the rounds that it feels surreal to have
                        anything officially confirmed. We've had leaks suggesting elements of the game's story, setting, features, and
                        other details, so it will be exciting to see what's revealed next by Rockstar.

                    <p class ="game_text2">ach and every month, as the midway shifts toward the end, many fans become excited for the
                        next PS Plus free game reveal. No two months are created equal, however, and many haven’t seemed too happy with
                        PS Plus so far this year—except for March. PS Plus’ free games for February 2022 were exceptionably
                        controversial, giving out niche or not-full games.
                    </p>

                    <p class ="game_text2">Typically, March releases for PS Plus follow a “big” pattern where it’s one of the best
                        months of the year. It seems safe to say that March 2022 may not have been the biggest March in recent years,
                        but it was still a solid month. Hopefully, what follows in April proves to be the same. There’s no telling what
                        Sony will reveal, expectedly on March 30, but here are a few games that could do well on the service.
